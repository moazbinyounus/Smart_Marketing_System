the administration of company in managing the effective sales of their products in wholesale. It helps managing, 
organising and tracking the stock record. System will give daily targets and promotions/daily schemes to each 
Distributer/Salesman. The system would also give clear view to the administration that how and which product is in
demand in certain areas with its smart learning system and maintains the trends of sales of different products on daily, 
weekly, monthly and annual basis. Through its smart notifications the communication is much faster and efficient.
Local systems are either slow or ineffective due to the issues in connectivity or databases. Though there are systems
like Alibaba, Amazon etc., but they keep their profit, requires skilled staff, have to pay customising and license costs
and import from abroad. Our system is designed for local markets and demands 0% profit from vendors. The system is based 
on different portals for different users.
